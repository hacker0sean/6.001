# programming challenges

1. testing (compare inputs and output)
2. defensive programming
3. eliminate source bug -- debugging  (study events) 



* Write specifications for functions(docs) (encourage to write) !!!!!!!!!!!
* Modularize programs
* Check conditions on inputs/outputs



## TESTING AND DEBUGGING

* unit testing (validate each piece of program)
* regression testing(catch reintroduced that were previously fixed) (might go back)
* integration testing (do overall program work) (not rush to this step)(might go back)



### TESTING APPROACHES

* NATURAL TESTING (there is natural partitions)

* RANDOM TESTING

* BLACK BOX TESTING(designed without looking at the code on account of the natural conditions) (extremes)

* GLASS BOX TESTING(looking at the code on account of the branches of the code) (still looking for boundaries conditions)

  ###PRINT STATEMENTS

* ENTER FUNCTION

* PARAMETERS

* FUNCTIONS RESULTS

* USE BISECTION METHOD




1. WRITE DOWN POTENTIAL BUG IN A COMMENT
2. WRITE A FUNCTION TO TEST
3. SAVE THE OLD VERSION!!!!!!!!
